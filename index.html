                <h4>Verified Gradute</h4>
                <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>"I was an EMT for manv vears before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experlence here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter, The next 12 weeks was the best -and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

                <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
                <br/>
                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, Ive never writen a line of code.I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not<br/>
                    disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to walt long for assistance, The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during Interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>

                <h4>Verified Gradute</h4>
                <p>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which 1 find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>
